# Old_Projects
In this section I have uploaded the projects I created to find my first DS job

1. Berlin_Marathon_Analysis
- The BMA is a project which is a simple analysis of the influence of weather conditions
  and other factors on the performance of Berlin Marathon runners over the years.

2. Customer_Churn_Telco
- It is a classification project predicting which customers will leave the company.
  It uses a competition of variables and, based on these, selects the classification model with the highest effectiveness.
  The data can be found in the project folder.

3. DS_Course_Projects
- These are projects I created while learning the basics. I do not have the data for them.
